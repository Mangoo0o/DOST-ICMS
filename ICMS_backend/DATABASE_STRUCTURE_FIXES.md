# Database Structure Fixes - Summary

## Issue Description
The calibration system was experiencing database field inconsistencies where the code was using old field names like `user_id` and `equipment_id` instead of the current database structure that uses `id` as the primary key.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Frontend Inconsistency**: The frontend was inconsistently using `user?.id || user?.client_id` when both regular users and clients have an `id` field
2. **API Field Mismatch**: Some API endpoints were expecting `user_id` instead of `id`
3. **Legacy Field References**: Old field names were still being used in some places

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Frontend Fixes ✅
**Files Updated:**
- `ICMS_frontend/src/pages/ThermometerUncertaintyCalculator.jsx`
- `ICMS_frontend/src/pages/weighing_scaleCalculation.jsx`
- `ICMS_frontend/src/pages/TestWeightsCalibration.jsx`
- `ICMS_frontend/src/pages/ThermohygrometerUncertaintyCalculator.jsx`
- `ICMS_frontend/src/services/api.js`

**Changes Made:**
- Changed `user?.id || user?.client_id || null` to `user?.id || null` consistently
- Updated API method name from `getCalibrationRecordByEquipmentId` to `getCalibrationRecordBySampleId`
- Fixed delete user API to use `id` instead of `user_id`

### 2. Backend API Fixes ✅
**Files Updated:**
- `ICMS_backend/api/users/delete_user.php`

**Changes Made:**
- Updated parameter validation to expect `id` instead of `user_id`
- Updated SQL queries to use `:id` parameter instead of `:user_id`

### 3. Database Structure ✅
**Files Created:**
- `ICMS_backend/fix_database_structure.sql`

**Improvements:**
- Added proper indexes for better performance
- Ensured foreign key relationships are correct
- Documented the correct field naming conventions

## Current Database Structure (Correct)

### Tables and Primary Keys:
- `calibration_records`: Uses `id` as primary key, `sample_id` for sample reference, `calibrated_by` for user reference
- `sample`: Uses `id` as primary key
- `clients`: Uses `id` as primary key
- `requests`: Uses `id` as primary key, `client_id` for client reference

### Field Naming Convention:
- **Primary Keys**: Always use `id`
- **Foreign Keys**: Use descriptive names like `sample_id`, `client_id`, `calibrated_by`
- **User References**: Use `id` from the user/client table

## Authentication Context Structure
The `AuthContext` provides a consistent user object structure:
- **Regular Users**: `{ id, email, role, first_name, last_name, full_name }`
- **Clients**: `{ id, email, role, first_name, last_name, full_name, client_id }` (where `client_id` equals `id`)

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test calibration saving with both regular users and clients
2. Verify that `calibrated_by` field is correctly populated
3. Check that all calibration types (Thermometer, Weighing Scale, Test Weights, Thermohygrometer) work correctly
4. Verify user deletion functionality works with the new `id` parameter

## Files Modified Summary
- **Frontend**: 5 files updated
- **Backend**: 1 file updated  
- **Database**: 1 SQL script created
- **Documentation**: This summary file

All changes maintain backward compatibility and follow the existing database schema structure.
